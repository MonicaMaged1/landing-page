This project is a conversion of a static version of the Landing Page to a dynamic version, based on the Udacity Course for the FrontEnd Nanodegree. 

## Description

This project provides a navigation bar that is built dynamically based on the available sections in the page. An unordered list is constructed based on the available sections.

When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link scrolls to the desired section.
